    2. Pull down the spotrac data either with code or just pull down into files

    3. Cut out all but the second row when sorting by name and then age; can assume contract's at second youngest age will be second contracts
    4. Standardize by season and by posiition?
    5. Calculate and plot correlations of each combine metric with contract value
